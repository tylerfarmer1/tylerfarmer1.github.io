## Scenario

Bellows College is an educational organization with multiple campuses and programs. Many of Bellow Colleges instructors and administrators need to attend events, and purchase items. Historically tracking these expenses has been a challenge.

Campus administration would like to modernize their expense reporting system where employees submit expenses. 

Throughout this course, you will build applications and perform automation to enable Bellows College employees to manage expenses.

In this Module 1 lab, you will acquire a Power Platform trial and access the Power Platform admin center. In the admin center, you will then create a **Practice** environment that you will perform the majority of your lab work in.
