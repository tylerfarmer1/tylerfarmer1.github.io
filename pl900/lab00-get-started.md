## Exercise 2 - Sign in to Power Apps

  > Note:     
  > - You **cannot** copy/paste from your computer inside the lab computer.<br>
  > - Clicking the **Green "T"** should type out any text following it.

3-Click **Next**, and do the same thing for the password.

## Exercise 3 - Create an Environment

1. In the left navigaion click **Environments.**  You'll probably have 2 environments:  **"Dev One"** and **"Contoso (default.)"**

2. Click **+ New** in the command bar at the top.  Use these settings:
    - For the **Name**, enter `XX Dev`  (use your initials instead of `XX`)
    - For the **Type**, change it to **Developer**
    - Click **Next** and then click **Save.** 

3. After a minute, you'll see all 3 Environments.  The new one will have a **State** of **Preparing.**  Click the **Refresh** link in the command bar periodically until the State is **Ready.**

4. Close that browser tab so you are back on the "maker" portal.

5. If the "Settings" tab is still open on the right, close it.

6. Do a "hard refresh" (**CTRL + F5**) in the browser.  Click on **Environment** in the upper-right and select your **XX Dev** Environment.
    - If you don't see it, do a hard refresh a few times.  If you still don't see it, let me know!
